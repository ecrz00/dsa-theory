# Data Structure and Algorithms - Journey
This repository contains theory and solutions to various problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) implemented in Python.
The primary goal of the repo is to:
* Track my progress and maintain a log of solved LeetCode problems.
* Serve as a resource for reviewing patterns and data structures.
* Practice writing clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code.

I strive to produce the best possible solution on my own. However, in cases where a problem requires a specific, more complex or not-enough clear pattern, the solution provided comes from others developer's solution. 
The following channels have been a huge guidance during this learning journey. A big thank you to them <3 and don't hesitate to visit them.
* [mycodeschool](https://www.youtube.com/@mycodeschool)
* [Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/@abdul_bari)
* [Greg Hogg](https://www.youtube.com/@GregHogg)
* [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode)

Each file has a consistent structure for easy review. The files' header includes:
* Description of the approach used.
  * Some problems have more than one solution, thus address the follow-ups (such as space complexity constraints)
* Time Complexity and Space Complexity
